# Image-Gen-Collapse
Studying the effect of model collapse on image generation models.


TO DO:
- Set up model env [DONE]
- train model to get baseline
- Introduce generated images to training data set
  - see how long it takes for output to degrade
  - reset the model and track how different levels of generated content in training data affect the time until collapse

- Compile findings into paper
