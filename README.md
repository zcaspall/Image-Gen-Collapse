# Image-Gen-Collapse
Studying the effect of model collapse on image generation models.


TO DO:
- Set up models env
- Pre-train the model
    - generate enough to make fully generated training set
    
- Introduce generated images to training data set
  - see how long it takes for output to degrade
  - reset the model and track how different levels of generated content in training data affect the time until collapse

- Compile findings into paper

MILE STONES:

- Set up both model envs
- Getting it break
- compile our findings
